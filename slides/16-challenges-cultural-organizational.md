Transitioning from siloed to collaborative mindset:
Implementing a data mesh requires a shift from a siloed mindset to a more collaborative approach, 
breaking down barriers between teams and promoting knowledge sharing.

Embracing domain-driven data ownership:
A crucial cultural shift is the move toward domain-driven data ownership, where data management is aligned with 
specific business domains, empowering domain experts to make data-related decisions.

Fostering a data product mindset:
Organizations need to adopt a data product mindset, treating data as a valuable asset that delivers value to its 
consumers and requires continuous improvement and iteration.

Encouraging continuous learning and innovation:
A data mesh implementation requires a culture that supports continuous learning and innovation, enabling teams to 
explore new technologies, methodologies, and best practices to enhance their data products.

Adapting to new roles and responsibilities:
The transition to a data mesh may require team members to adapt to new roles and responsibilities, 
such as data product owners, data engineers, and data domain experts, to support the new data management paradigm effectively.
