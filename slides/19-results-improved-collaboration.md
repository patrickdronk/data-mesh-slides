Breaking down data silos:
Data mesh encourages collaboration by breaking down data silos, making it easier for teams to access, share, and 
utilize data across the organization.

Cross-functional domain-specific data teams:
By organizing teams around specific business domains, data mesh fosters collaboration among team members with 
diverse skills and expertise, leading to more effective data management and decision-making.

Knowledge sharing and learning opportunities:
Data mesh promotes a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous learning, enabling teams to learn from each other's 
experiences, best practices, and innovative approaches.

Shared data infrastructure and tools:
A shared data infrastructure and set of self-service tools encourage collaboration by making it easier for teams to 
access, process, and analyze data, leading to more informed decision-making and insights.

Collaborative data governance and standardization:
Data mesh supports collaborative data governance and standardization, enabling teams to work together to establish 
and maintain consistent data policies, practices, and quality standards across the organization
