# Challenges of the monolithic data architectures
<v-clicks>

- Inflexible and rigid structures
- Difficulty in scaling and handling large data volumes
- Time-consuming changes and updates
- Limited agility for cross-functional teams
- Inefficient data governance and security

<!--
- Monolithic data architectures often have tightly coupled components, making it hard to modify or extend them without impacting the entire system.
- As data volumes grow, monolithic architectures struggle to scale horizontally and can suffer from performance bottlenecks.
- Due to the interconnected nature of components, making changes or updates to one part of the system can require extensive coordination and can be time-consuming.
- Engineering teams must collaborate closely and rely on centralized decision-making, which can slow down the development process and limit the agility of teams to respond to changing requirements.
- With a centralized approach to data management, ensuring proper governance and security can be challenging as it requires strict coordination and oversight across teams and data pipelines.
