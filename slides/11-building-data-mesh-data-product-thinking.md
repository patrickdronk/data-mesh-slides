<!--
Treating data as a product: Data product thinking emphasizes the importance of treating data as a valuable product that delivers value to its consumers, both internal and external.
Focused on delivering value to consumers: By considering data as a product, teams focus on ensuring the data's quality, usability, and accessibility to deliver maximum value to its consumers.
Establishing clear data product ownership: Data product thinking promotes the assignment of clear ownership for each data product, ensuring accountability and responsibility for the data's quality and maintenance.
Aligning data products with business domains: Aligning data products with specific business domains enables domain experts to manage and control their data products effectively, ensuring better understanding and utilization of the data.
Continuous improvement and iteration: Just like any other product, data products need continuous improvement and iteration based on consumer feedback and evolving requirements, ensuring that they remain relevant and valuable over time.
