<!--
Multiple data sources and formats:
A data mesh involves dealing with a complex ecosystem of multiple data sources and formats, making data ingestion, 
processing, and integration more challenging.

Decentralized data management:
The decentralization of data management in a data mesh can increase complexity, as domain-specific data teams need 
to coordinate and collaborate effectively to maintain a cohesive data ecosystem.

Integration and interoperability challenges:
Ensuring seamless integration and interoperability between different data products and tools within the data mesh can
be complex, requiring standardized processes and interfaces.

Maintaining consistency and quality:
In a complex data ecosystem, maintaining consistency and quality across various data products becomes crucial. 
This requires well-defined standards and governance policies, as well as continuous monitoring and improvement efforts.

Evolving technology landscape:
As the technology landscape continues to evolve, organizations need to adapt and embrace new tools, platforms, 
and methodologies to stay competitive in managing their data ecosystem effectively.
