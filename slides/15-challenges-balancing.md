<!--
Establishing organization-wide standards:
While providing autonomy to domain-specific data teams, it's essential to establish organization-wide standards for data quality, security, and privacy to maintain consistency and trust in the data ecosystem.
Encouraging innovation while maintaining control:
Balancing autonomy and governance allows data teams to experiment and innovate while ensuring that they stay within the boundaries set by data governance policies and standards.
Providing self-service infrastructure with guidelines:
By offering self-service infrastructure and tools along with clear usage guidelines, organizations can enable data teams to access and manage data independently while adhering to governance principles.
Promoting a culture of collaboration and accountability:
Encouraging collaboration between domain-specific data teams and fostering a culture of accountability helps strike the right balance between autonomy and governance, ensuring that data is used effectively and responsibly across the organization.
