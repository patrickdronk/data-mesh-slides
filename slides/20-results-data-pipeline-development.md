<!--
Decentralized and domain-focused pipelines:
In a data mesh, data pipelines are developed by domain-specific data teams, focusing on the specific needs and requirements
of their business domain, leading to more efficient and tailored pipelines.

Standardized interfaces and data formats:
To ensure seamless data flow and interoperability between pipelines, data mesh encourages the use of standardized 
interfaces and data formats across the organization.

Reusable components and modular design:
By promoting the use of reusable components and modular design, data mesh makes it easier for teams to develop, 
maintain, and iterate on their data pipelines, improving overall efficiency.

Continuous integration and deployment:
Data mesh supports continuous integration and deployment practices, enabling teams to rapidly develop, test, and 
deploy new data pipelines or updates to existing pipelines.

Monitoring, logging, and error handling:
78Robust monitoring, logging, and error handling are essential for maintaining the reliability and quality of data 
pipelines in a data mesh, ensuring that any issues are quickly detected and resolved.
