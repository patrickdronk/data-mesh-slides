# Data mesh comparison

<v-clicks>

- Architecture: Decentralized vs. Centralized
- Data Ownership: Domain-driven vs. Centralized team
- Infrastructure: Self-service vs. Managed service
- Governance: Semi-governed vs. Strictly governed
- Scalability: High scalability vs. Limited scalability

<!---
- Data mesh promotes a decentralized architecture, giving teams more autonomy, 
  whereas monolithic architectures rely on a centralized data management approach, 
  which can limit innovation and agility.
- In a data mesh, data ownership is aligned with specific business domains, 
  while in a traditional monolithic architecture, data ownership is often centralized, 
  leading to inefficiencies and lack of domain expertise.
- Data mesh enables teams to access, discover, and use data efficiently through self-service infrastructure, 
  whereas in a monolithic architecture, teams often depend on centralized data teams for their data needs.
- Data mesh establishes standards and guidelines for data governance while still providing autonomy to domain teams. 
  In contrast, traditional monolithic architectures typically enforce a strictly governed approach, 
  which can hinder flexibility.
- Data mesh architectures are designed for resilience and scalability, while traditional monolithic architectures are 
  often rigid and challenging to scale, especially as data volumes grow and business needs change.
