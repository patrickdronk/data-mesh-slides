# The Data Mesh

<!--
If I explained it to my mother
Traditionally, all the LEGO bricks are kept in one big box, and everyone who wants to build something needs to go to this box to find their pieces.


However, as you play more and more with your friends, you start to realize that it's difficult to find the pieces you need because there are so many 
pieces in the box. Also, the box is becoming a mess because everyone is rummaging through it at the same time.

This is similar to the traditional centralized data architecture, where all data is stored in one place (like a data warehouse or data lake), 
and anyone who needs data for analysis or application development must go to this warehouse.

This is similar to the problem large organizations face. As the amount of data grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to manage and use the 
data effectively.
