# The Data Mesh

<!--
- Data mesh moves away from centralized data management, enabling independent teams to own and maintain their data products, fostering innovation and agility.
- Data ownership is based on specific business domains, allowing domain experts to manage and control their data products effectively.
- Data mesh promotes self-service capabilities, enabling teams to access, discover, and use data more efficiently without relying on a centralized data team.
- While providing autonomy to domain teams, data mesh also establishes standards and guidelines for data governance to ensure consistency and quality across the organization.
- Data mesh architecture is designed to be resilient and scalable, easily adapting to growing data volumes and changing business needs.
