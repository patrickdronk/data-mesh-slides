<!--
Treating data as a product: 
Data product thinking emphasizes the importance of treating data as a valuable product that delivers value to its 
consumers, both internal and external.

Focused on delivering value to consumers: 
By considering data as a product, teams focus on ensuring the data's quality, usability, and accessibility to 
deliver maximum value to its consumers.

Establishing clear data product ownership: 
Data product thinking promotes the assignment of clear ownership for each data product, ensuring accountability 
and responsibility for the data's quality and maintenance.
