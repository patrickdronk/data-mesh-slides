Establishing data governance policies:
In a data mesh, it's essential to establish data governance policies that outline the roles, responsibilities, and processes related to data management across the organization.

Defining data quality standards:
Setting data quality standards ensures that data products across the organization maintain a consistent level of accuracy, completeness, and reliability.

Creating metadata and schema standards:
Establishing metadata and schema standards helps maintain consistency in data representation and organization, making it easier for teams to discover, understand, and use data from different sources.

Implementing security and privacy guidelines:
Data mesh governance should include guidelines for data security and privacy to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

Monitoring and auditing data usage:
Regular monitoring and auditing of data usage help ensure that data products adhere to governance policies and quality standards, and also identify areas for improvement and potential risks.
