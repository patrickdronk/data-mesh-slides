<!--

Domain-specific data teams reduce bottlenecks:
By distributing data management responsibilities across domain-specific data teams, data mesh helps 
reduce bottlenecks and streamline data workflows, improving overall agility.

Scalable infrastructure and self-service tools:
A data mesh's scalable infrastructure and self-service tools empower teams to access and manage data independently, 
allowing the organization to scale more effectively as data volumes and complexity grow.

Encouraging innovation and experimentation:
Data mesh fosters a culture of innovation and experimentation by providing domain-specific data teams with the 
autonomy to explore new technologies and methodologies, driving continuous improvement.

Adapting quickly to changing business requirements:
With improved scalability and agility, organizations can adapt more rapidly to changing business requirements, 
ensuring that their data-driven systems remain relevant and effective in driving business outcomes.
